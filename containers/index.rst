In this section you will find resources to help you use containers for your accelerated deep learning model acceleration on top of Inferentia and Trainium enabled instances. 

The section is organized based on the target deployment environment
and use case.  In most cases, it is recommended to use a preconfigured
`Deep Learning Container (DLC) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/deep-learning-containers/latest/devguide/what-is-dlc.html>`_ from AWS.
Each DLC is pre-configured to have all of the Neuron components installed and is specific to the chosen ML Framework.

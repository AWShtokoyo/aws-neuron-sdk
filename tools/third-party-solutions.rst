Third-party solutions
====================

AWS Neuron integrates with multiple third-party partner solutions that alow you to run deep learning workloads on Amazon EC2 
instances powered by AWS Trainium and AWS Inferentia chips. The following list gives an overview of third-party solutions 
that work with AWS Neuron.

Weights & Bias
""""""""""""""
Weights & Biases is a machine learning platform for developers to build better models faster. Use W&B's lightweight, interoperable 
tools to quickly track experiments, version and iterate on datasets, evaluate model performance, reproduce models, visualize results 
and spot regressions, and share findings with colleagues.

Datadog
"""""""
Datadog, an observability and security platform, provides real-time monitoring for cloud infrastructure and ML operations. Datadog is 
excited to launch its AWS Neuron integration, which pulls metrics collected by Neuron SDKâ€™s Neuron Monitor tool into Datadog, 
enabling users to track the performance of their Trainium and Inferentia-based instances. By providing real-time visibility into 
model performance and hardware usage, Datadog helps customers ensure efficient training and inference, optimized resource 
utilization, and the prevention of service slowdowns.

.. note::

    Neuron DET is no longer supported as of Neuron 2.22.0 release. All customers using the NDET tool for debugging runtime hangs/issues in large-scale settings should transition to the Neuron Profiler 2.0. This tool offers the same runtime function level traces with improved ease of use and optimized performance. For more information on Neuron Profiler 2.0, please refer to the :ref:`neuron-profiler-2-0-guide`.

Overview
--------

The Neuron Distributed Event Tracing (NDET) tool ``neuron-det`` aggregates Neuron execution trace logs and visualizes
events leading up to a failure.  It is intended to help diagnose errors
when running multi-node workloads by surfacing known software or hardware issues.

.. note::

    ``neuron-det`` requires ``aws-neuronx-runtime-lib`` and ``aws-neuronx-tools`` from Neuron SDK 2.16 or above.

.. note::

    Enabling the tracing will impact performance.  It is recommended to enable this for debug purposes only.

Using neuron-det
----------------

When the execution tracing is enabled, running a workload will generate additional logs at an
interval, which can later be post-processed by ``neuron-det``.

Logging is controlled via the following environment variables:

.. list-table::
    :widths: 80 40 260
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Argument
      - Default value
      - Description
    * - ``NEURON_RT_DBG_NDET_FLUSH_USEC``
      - ``0``
      - Contols the frequency at which these logs are flushed.  Setting this to a non-zero value will enable the logging.
    * - ``NEURON_RT_DBG_NDET_LOG_LOCATION``
      - ``/tmp``
      - Path to an existing directory where logs will be written.
    * - ``NEURON_RT_DBG_NDET_NUM_ENTRIES``
      - ``20000``
      - The number of events to keep in the buffer for context.

These are generated on a per-process basis, ie. two processes will generate two separate log files.
With the default settings, each log will be up to 20MB.

After collecting the logs, running ``neuron-det`` will attempt to determine the underlying issue (if any).

If the model executed to completion without errors, running ``neuron-det`` would show ``no errors detected âœ“``.

Otherwise, when an error is detected, a message would be printed to the console with extra information, for example
``numerical_error (X) NC 0 @ 11762897.0 - 11906423.0: {'nd': 0, 'nc': 0, 'exec_id': 0}``.
* ``numerical_error`` is to the type of event.
* ``X`` is a "complete" event (see |chrome_trace_reference| for details). Non complete events likely indicate a hang.
* ``NC 0`` is the NeuronCore which the model is being executed on.
* ``11762897.0 - 11906423.0`` are the start and end timestamps of the event.
* ``{'nd': 0, 'nc': 0, 'exec_id': 0}`` are the extra details associated with this event.

``neuron-det`` will also generate a JSON file which can be loaded and viewed as a chrome-trace by navigating to ``chrome://tracing``
in the Chrome browser.

CLI arguments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. list-table::
    :widths: 40 80 260
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Argument
      - Default value
      - Description
    * - ``--log-prefix``
      - N/A, required argument
      - The directory or prefix where the NDET logs are stored
    * - ``-o, --output-file``
      - ``trace.json``
      - Output file location of the chrome-trace JSON
    * - ``--ranks``
      - N/A
      - Filtering based on the rank number for Collective Communication
    * - ``--show-dependencies``
      - false
      - Draw arrows between certain events in the chrome-trace for easier backtracking


Example usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block::

    export NEURON_RT_DBG_NDET_FLUSH_USEC=5000000
    export NEURON_RT_DBG_NDET_LOG_LOCATION=ndet
    mkdir -p $NEURON_RT_DBG_NDET_LOG_LOCATION
    python app.py
    neuron-det --log-prefix $NEURON_RT_DBG_NDET_LOG_LOCATION -o trace.json

Example output
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following is collected from running the |pcluster_dp_bert_tutorial| on two nodes with NDET enabled.

After executing this model, there will be a few `ndet_*` files present in the directory specified earlier.
From here, we can execute ``neuron-det --log-prefix $NEURON_RT_DBG_NDET_LOG_LOCATION/ndet -o trace.json``.

In this example, since we used two nodes, we would see two separate processes in the chrome trace.
Each would process has the corresponding file name that the data comes from, which includes the date and time
when the tracing started, the instance ID, and the replica group IDs (GIDs) used for collective communication.

Generally the application will either complete successfully, or stop after encountering an error.  Thus it would be
a good idea to start by inspecting the tail end of the trace.

|ndet_chrome_trace|

On the left, each number label corresponds with the NeuronCore index.  Each core would show the activities be executed at a point in time,
such as loading a model, or more commonly executions.  The ``nc_exec`` events show the duration of execution on the NeuronCores, whereas
the ``nrt_execute`` events shows the duration of the execution request, including any runtime overhead.  The ``sync_exec`` event has
information on the NEFF that is being executed, with different NEFFs color-coded.

Any NEFFs that include collective communication operations (CC Ops) will have additional information, namely the ``cc_exec_barrier`` and 
``cc_op_exec`` events.  In this example, the last execution (where ``sync_exec`` is blue) contains CC Ops.  However, before CC Ops can begin,
we need to synchonize between all the workers participating (the replica group), which is the ``cc_exec_barrier``.  After this barrier, execution
can continue.  As part of the hardware execution (nested directly under the ``nc_exec``), each CC Op will have a corresponding ``cc_op_exec`` event (in pink).
When an execution times out (due to hardware failure, issues with the compiled NEFF, etc.), this information may be useful when determining whether the
problem lies in the collective communcation or elsewhere.

Any error event detected will be displayed in red, with ``ret`` would be set according to :ref:`nrt_api`
in the details when clicked.

|ndet_error_detail|

In this case, a 1003 correlates to a numerical error (NaN) which may be an issue with the inputs or the compiled model.

For additional troubleshooting, please open a ticket on the Neuron Github page and include the instance IDs,
version information, NDET logs, and any other debug information as necessary.

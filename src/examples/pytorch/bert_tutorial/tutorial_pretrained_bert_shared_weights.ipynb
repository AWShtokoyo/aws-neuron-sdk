This shows the effect of using Shared Weights as the device memory usage is lower. If you change ``NEURON_RT_MULTI_INSTANCE_SHARED_WEIGHTS`` to \"FALSE\" you will see that \"Device Used Memory\" is 3.2GB, and the model instances loaded onto  NeuronDevice 0 NeuronCore 0 and 1 use the most device memory (360MB) while the other model instances now use 180MB each."

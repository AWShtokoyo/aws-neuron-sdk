      weights (_type_): Fused QKV linear weights, assumed to be eltwise-multiplied with RMS norm weight vector (gamma)
      out_tensor (_type_): Output tensor
      norm_dtype (_type_, optional): Data type for RMS norm, should be f32 to avoid NaN. Defaults to nl.float32.

  r"""
  Allocated fused self attention kernel for small head size Stable Diffusion workload.
  
  Computes (softmax(Q.T@K)V).T. The wired layout is chosen to avoid transpose as
  much as possible to simplify the debug. The kernel uses the direct allocation API,
  and implements double buffering to achieve better performance than automatic allocation.
  As of NeuronSDK 2.21, it achieves 18% better performance than auto allocated equivalent.
  To see the performance gap, you can use ``force_auto_alloc`` decorator to override
  manual allocation and benchmark the performance difference.

  This kernel is designed to be used for Stable Diffusion models where the 
  n_heads is equal to 128. Seqlen must be divisible by 1024, and smaller than 5120. 
  Assertion is thrown if ``n_heads`` or sequence length does not satisfy the requirement.
  These restrictions are to simplify the address calculation in allocations.

  IO tensor layouts:
   - q_ptr: shape   (bs, d_heads, seq_q)
   - k_ptr: shape   (bs, d_heads, seq_k)
   - v_ptr: shape   (bs, seq_v, n_heads)
   - out_ptr: shape (bs, d_heads, seq_q)
   - We use seq_q and seq_k just for clarity, this kernel requires seq_q == seq_k

  IO tensor dtypes:
   - This kernel assumes all IO tensors have the same dtype
   - If mixed_percision is True, then all Tensor Engine operation will be performed in
     bfloat16 and accumulation will be performed in float32. Otherwise the intermediates
     will be in the same type as the inputs.

  Compile-time Constants:
    - softmax_scale: scaling for softmax, is None, default is `1.0/(d**0.5)`
    - mixed_precision: flag to set non-matmul ops in fp32 precision, default is set to `true`, if false, we use same precision as input types

        seq_tile_size: `default=2048`, size of the kv tile size for attention computation reduction
        training: bool to indicate training vs inference `default=True`

  Performance Notes:
    For better performance, the kernel is tiled to be of size `LARGE_TILE_SZ`, and Flash attention math techniques are applied in unit
    of `LARGE_TILE_SZ`. Seqlen that is not divisible by `LARGE_TILE_SZ` is not supported at the moment.

  GQA support Notes:
    the spmd kernel for launching kernel should be on kv_heads instead of nheads

Neuron performance
==================
The Neuron performance pages provide a reference to the expected performance of various open-source models for popular 
deep learning in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV) and Recommender model tasks. We have included with 
each model links to allow you to setup and reconstruct the test with a few steps.
